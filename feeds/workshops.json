A sound understanding of this computational model makes programming in R much easier and more productive! This workshop series is intended for active engagement – be prepared to come to each session with questions about why some things worked, and others didn't. All researchers (students, postdocs, faculty and staff) who meet the ‘prerequisites' are welcome to register for this workshop series, which is being offered in person at the UC Davis DataLab, and will be broadcast as part of UC Love Data Week. An optional final 5th session will be offered entirely remotely for additional Q&A by all audiences.

Come prepared to apply takeaways from the readings to unpacking provided case studies from the health sciences, and your own research processes. Researchers from all domains are welcome to participate. Together we'll brainstorm how as individuals and a community we can contribute to more equitable data-driven research.",

        "description": "Virtual Reality (VR) has evolved from an expensive and finicky niche technology only available at well-funded large institutions, into a practical consumer product with tremendous research potential. While current-generation VR devices are primarily intended for the video gaming market, their use is not limited to gaming and has tremendous potential for researchers. The VR Research Initiative at UC Davis DataLab is translating visualization technology initially created for the UC Davis W.M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES), to function with modern commodity VR devices. By developing and supporting open-source software for gaming VR headsets, DataLab seeks to promote equitable access to emerging technologies and enable diverse communities of researchers and the public to explore 3D data. In this session, we will discuss the fundamental principles and reasons why VR is highly effective for the analysis of large and complex three-dimensional data. We will introduce several concrete VR applications based on those principles that are being developed at UC Davis DataLab, and will describe how participants can build their own VR systems, able to run DataLabs VR applications, at their own institutions. By the end of this session participants will be able to: describe how current-generation virtual reality (VR) technology such as VR headsets meant for gaming can effectively be used for scientific data analysis; discuss why VR is useful for analysis of data, specifically complex and large three-dimensional data; and identify where to go to learn more about setting up their own VR systems using the latest VR technologies for research.",

While laws determine the legal parameters governing data use, data science approaches that are technically legal can still be used unethically and irresponsibly, with disastrous consequences from loss of revenue to human rights violations. Through case studies and interactive sessions, this workshop provides an overview of how to practice responsible data science by incorporating considerations of ethics, equity, and justice. We will discuss FACT (fairness, accuracy, confidentiality, and transparency) based approaches to increasing the integrity of our work in data science. By the end of this workshop, learner should be able to: Describe examples of how the development of data science can both contribute to inequities and be leveraged to address them in their own domain. Begin to identify the underlying goals and incentives influencing their data-driven research. Assess whether a research project's data meets FAIR criteria. Use a responsible data science framework to evaluate the potential impact(s) of a research project case study. Revise their research design using FACT principles.",

        "description": "First Session: Sharing and reusing data can effectively reduce redundant efforts in data collection, ultimately saving valuable time and resources, especially for smaller laboratories. Additionally, it enhances the efficiency of scientific research investments by preventing the reinvention of the wheel. Building a sustainable data-reuse process and culture relies on frameworks that comprise policies, standards, roles, and responsibilities, all of which must address the diverse needs of data providers, curators, and (re)users alike. A critical step in the data sharing and (re)use cycle involves researchers identifying data that are (re)usable for their needs. It is a common challenge among researchers to locate data that appear (re)usable. In this session, I aim to introduce 2-3 data repositories ideal for researchers seeking (re)usable data for their studies. Additionally, I will offer several tips and strategies for identifying and utilizing (re)usable data effectively. The session is structured to last approximately 45 minutes, encompassing a 25-minute presentation, a 5-minute question-and-answer segment, and a 10-minute practical workshop exercise. Second Session: Social media is increasingly becoming an important site for data collection and research for students, researchers, and scholars across the Humanities and Social Sciences. This workshop introduces participants to the existing landscape of social media data and the fluctuating access academics have to ‘big datasets'. Using Facebook, Twitter (or X), and Reddit as examples of data archives, we discuss the latest guidelines and restrictions on scraping social media data from these three platforms and how they affect researchers conducting social media research. The workshop urges participants to rethink their notion of “Data” concerning social media to foreground the issue of research ethics that is often sidestepped or not taken seriously due to the presumed publicness of social media data.",
