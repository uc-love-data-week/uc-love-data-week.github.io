  description: "APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as powerful tools for accessing and interacting with data in a structured and automated manner, providing capabilities far beyond what is possible through traditional interfaces. Despite their ubiquity in software development, APIs remain underutilized in humanities research, where they offer immense potential for innovative data collection and analysis.

In this session, we’ll demystify APIs and showcase their potential through the Library of Congress API. Participants will see step-by-step how to identify if a collection has API access, construct requests, and interpret responses, all with tools like Postman. We’ll walk through concepts like authentication, endpoints, parameters, and how to transform JSON responses into tabular data for visualization.

This session is designed as a show-and-tell introduction—perfect for researchers and students with no prior coding or data analysis experience. By the end, attendees will have a clear understanding of how APIs work, their practical applications, and how to start integrating them into their research workflows. Get ready to see what APIs can do for your projects!"

This session will feature QualiAnon, an open-source tool designed to help researchers securely anonymize and pseudonymize sensitive qualitative data with precision and flexibility. Unlike automated tools that rely on blind substitutions, QualiAnon gives you full control over how and when data is anonymized, allowing you to manually define replacement rules for specific datasets or variables. This approach ensures a higher level of accuracy and privacy by stripping identifying information without compromising the richness of the data. In this session, we’ll demonstrate how QualiAnon can streamline your data protection efforts, improve your workflow, and ensure compliance with privacy standards. Don’t miss the chance to discover how this tool can simplify the de-identification process while safeguarding sensitive information in your research!"

As described by the UC Berkeley Oral History Center, this approach involves producing "first-person narrative topical and life histories that explore the narrator’s understanding of events through a recorded interview...[this] results in a lightly edited transcript of the interview that the narrator reviews, which is then published." This differs from the more familiar qualitative research interview, in that it is a two-directional, and transparent process... which comes with its own challenges. In this workshop you will learn more about these synergies and contrasts between and within methods, hear more about best practices for conducting oral history projects, and have time to ask questions about project ideas of your own.'

  description: "Sharing and reusing data can effectively reduce redundant efforts in data collection. It also enhances the efficiency of scientific research investments by preventing the reinvention of the wheel. Building a sustainable data-reuse process and culture requires frameworks that include policies, standards, roles, and responsibilities, all of which must address the diverse needs of data providers, curators, and (re)users alike.

A critical step in the data sharing and (re)use cycle involves researchers depositing their research data into data-sharing infrastructures, keeping their data in a sharable and usable form, making other researchers aware of their data, and identifying data that are (re)usable for their needs.

In this session, I aim to introduce some ideas and techniques for preparing research data for sharing. I will also introduce 2 to 3 data repositories ideal for researchers depositing their data and seeking (re)usable data for their studies. Additionally, I will offer several tips and strategies for identifying and utilizing (re)usable data effectively.

The session is structured to last approximately 50 minutes, comprising a 40-minute presentation followed by a 10-minute question-and-answer segment."

  description: UCLA library holds one of the largest collections of Islamic manuscripts (roughly 10,000 items) covering multiple languages including Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu, and spanning nearly 9 centuries (12th-20th). Currently, UCLA Library Special Collections is in the process of a multi-year effort to create digital records for its Islamic Manuscript holdings. At HumTech, our team is engaged in a project to visualize the cataloged manuscripts through Tableau. The goal of this project is to represent a birds eye view of the Islamic manuscript holdings for interested researchers. Through representation of multiple data points that the library cataloging process captured from the manuscripts, the visualization hopes to provide easy access to researchers for dissecting the data in multiple ways and helping them in drawing useful insights into the Islamic manuscript holdings at UCLA. In this presentation, we will be discussing the challenges that we faced in data cleaning, wrangling and visualization that are specific to manuscript collections, especially one that is primarily in non-Latin script and spans to the pre-modern period.

  description: Join us for a workshop designed to equip you with the skills to responsibly assess and use existing datasets for new research. Using the U.S. National Parks Visit Data as a real-world example, we will consider key issues in reusing data, including historical context, data collection methods, and ethical aspects of the dataset. This workshop will underscore the importance of documentation, provenance, and context in utilizing existing datasets for research, and participants will gain skills in evaluating data for reuse and suitability for their work.

  description: Learn how to utilize Tableau Prep Builder and Tableau to showcase your data. From data cleaning, hiding blank fields, to data filtering, Tableau Prep can be used to organize your data more efficiently. Once the data is clean, Tableau can be used to visualize the data ranging from charts, graphs, and even GPS coordinates. This small workshop will show you how anyone can easily use Tableau Prep and Tableau for data organization and analysis.

  description: The Industry Documents Library is a digital archive of documents created by industries which influence public health, hosted by the University of California, San Francisco Library. This archive contains millions of video, audio, and image files from the tobacco, opioids, fossil fuel, drug, and food industries, including advertisements, legal depositions, internal marketing documents, public health campaigns, and other historical records. This session will start with a presentation and overview of the contents of the IDL and search interface. Next, we will introduce a python based, open-source stack researchers can use to analyze, transcribe, and categorize data in IDL video, audio, and image files. Although participants will have an opportunity to try out these technologies during the workshop, the primary focus will be an overview of available tools and data, and participation in the programming sections is optional.
