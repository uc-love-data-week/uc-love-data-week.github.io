  description:  This workshop covers an introduction to natural language processing (NLP) and caveats for its application to health data. Using the R programming language we will introduce the basics of text processing and demo how to calculate common metrics including word frequencies, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), and principal component analysis (PCA) to explore important words and group similar documents. We will also introduce more advanced NLP topics (sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc.) and discuss classical versus deep learning approaches, as time permits. Learners with proficient R skills are encouraged to code along.

  description:  This workshop will teach you how to gather information from websites using tools available in the R programmming language. You'll learn how scrape data from web tables using the rvest package, and how to track the social media trends captured in Twitter hashtags using the rtweet package. The workshop is geared towards intermediate R users, but we welcome a wide audience to join us and observe the demonstrations.

  description:  Have you ever wanted to harvest data off a website that was not already in an analysis-friendly format? If so, this web scraping workshop is for you! Web scraping can be done entirely manually but it is usually faster, more efficient and less error-prone if automated. UCSB Research Data Services will navigate you through some basic web scraping techniques including how to use XPath and the Chrome web browser with the Scraper extension to extract data from the web with little technical knowlege.  We will also discuss the ethical issues of web scraping.

  time:   1:00 - 3:00 pm
  description:  This workshop will unpack the subjective process of data visualization and its relationship to concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion. We'll critically explore how data can be used to uphold and perpetuate, or quantify and demonstrate structural oppression. Through this workshop learners will practice the technique of "data visceralization," the process of experiencing differences in data and understanding them viscerally. This workshop is led by UC Davis DataLab's Data Feminism research and learning cluster, which focuses on thinking about data science and data ethics as informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism.
