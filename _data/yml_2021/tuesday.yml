  info: "<u>Title</u><br><b>Elizabeth S. (UCM)</b><br><br>Access to research data is essential for reproducing pre-existing findings, facilitating collaboration, and developing new insights through secondary analysis. As a researcher, how do you locate data sets that are relevant to your research? This workshop will provide an introduction to the data repository landscape and strategies for navigating data sources to discover relevant and usable data with a focus on supporting research in the social sciences."

  info: "<u>Geocoding Address Data: Approaches to Personally Identifiable Data</u><br><b>UC Davis</b><br><br>Geocoding is the process of estimating a real-world location (typically we think of latitude & longitude) from a postal address. In this workshop, we’ll discuss the concepts needed to geocode data, understand options for working with personally identifiable data and non-identifiable data, and gain some hands-on experience with geocoding address data using QGIS, a GIS with a graphical user interface."

This workshop will share resources for discovering textual, visual, spatial, and social network data of use to students and scholars across humanities disciplines. We will also look at a variety of digital tools and methodologies that humanities researchers are using to computationally answer research questions and generate new ones. Whether you are new to Digital Humanities or have been engaged in digital research or teaching for years, join us to share your questions and connect with other UCR community members interested in DH."

  info: "<u>Tidy Tuesday: clean up a data set</u><br><b>UC Los Angeles (host)</b><br><br>A weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As this project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem. However, any code-based methodology is welcome - just please remember to share the code used to generate the results."

  info: "<u>Ethical considerations in data</u><br><b>UC Los Angeles, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego</b><br><br>In this one hour interactive workshop, data librarians from UCLA, UCB, and UCSD will host an open discussion around data ethics focusing on case studies of participant data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the social justice components of research. The discussion will also include an overview of related resources available at various UC campuses, including further reading available through the libraries and groups on campus conducting research in these areas."
