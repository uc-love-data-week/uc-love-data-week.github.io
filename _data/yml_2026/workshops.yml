  description: "Modern GenAI vision models can describe scenes and identify objects impressively well, but their classifications can still shift depending on how they are prompted. This talk explores a GenAI system’s ability to detect smoking imagery in a visually busy ’80s sci-fi video by breaking the video into 1-second frames and evaluating two prompts: one that encourages detection and one that emphasizes neutrality. Multiple runs of each prompt are compared to examine changes in precision, recall, accuracy, and overall consistency. The session offers a practical look at how prompt phrasing and model variability affect real-world use cases, and what to keep in mind when using GenAI tools for content analysis."

It started when I was daydreaming at work about my Dungeons & Dragons campaign and realized the best way to learn these tools (for me) was to take the 'work' out of the equation.<p>Join me for a case study on how I used a personal D&D database as a 'sandbox' to learn high-impact data skills. By working with data I knew intimately (and didn't mind breaking), I was able to experiment with AI tools, fail safely, and eventually build a working automated pipeline. This isn't a talk about being a coding genius; it's about how a librarian harnessed curiosity and personal passion to gain a better understanding of how these often intimidating black-box tools actually work.</p><p>This session is designed for:
    <ul>
    <li>Researchers, Scholars, and Practitioners interested in 'Ground Truth' testing—using known data to safely audit the strengths, weaknesses, and limits of AI tools before trusting them with your scholarship.</li>
    <li>Librarians who want a practical look at how a researcher might approach the steep learning curve of this landscape. This session offers a viable path for building the technical vocabulary to translate user needs to technical experts/developers as well as applying these skills to your own work.</li>
    <li>Technical Experts & Data Scientists who support research. By watching a 'research hacker' navigate the messy reality of AI integration, you will see how users who 'know enough to be dangerous' actually approach these problems—offering insights on how to better anticipate pitfalls and guide the campus community.</li>

  description: "If a picture tells a thousand words then a data visualization can convey a million! Join us to learn how to apply data visualization principles and best practices to generate compelling plots with ggplot in R. Through a series of case studies, we'll make static plots and practice iterating to improve upon them and the data stories they tell.
    <p>This workshop is for current R users who want to expand their plotting skills, and thus is not an introduction to the R programming langauge. It is part of DataLab's 'Intermediate R' training series, which you can learn more about on our training website.</p>
    <p>After completing this workshop, learners should be able to:
      <ul>
      <li>write code to generate plots in R using the ggplot2 package</li>
      <li>develop various different plot types (dot plots, histograms, bar charts, boxplots, time series, etc.)</li>
      <li>employ ggplot's grammar of graphics syntax to customize plots,</li>
      <li>effectively use layers and aesthetics to make plots more informative and meaningful (including adding groupings, scaling, color, faceting, labels, and trendlines)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This workshop is offered in person and as a virtual broadcast as part of UC Love Data Week. Local learners are encouraged to attend in person. All members of the University of California system are welcome to register. Advance registration required.</p>
      <b>Prerequisites</b><p>
      This workshop is intended for motivated learners from all domains at UC Davis and the other UCs who want to hone their existing R skills. Thus, we won't cover introductory R questions during this session. Participants should be comfortable with basic R syntax, and have the latest version of R and RStudio pre-installed and running on their laptops. If you're new to R, or want to brush up, we suggest you start with our 'R Basics' workshop curriculum."

We’ll look at a few short examples using tools such as DataTables, Plotly, and Shiny. You will leave with practical tips on creating, sharing, and sustaining interactive graphics. <p>No prior experience with interactive visualization is required.</p><p>Note: This session is part of Data to Discovery, a biweekly virtual series hosted by the UCSB Library. This series highlights practical tools and core principles for working with data and engaging in open science. Each 30-minute session is designed to be concise, focused, and practical.</p>"

  description: Although R is an incredibly powerful programming language for data analysis and decision support, it is not widely known among the general public. The Shiny package enables R users to turn their data analysis code into web applications with user-friendly interfaces that are easy to deploy. This hands-on workshop will provide an introduction to Shiny including the principles of reactive programming, fundamentals of UI design, and deployment options. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to convert a spreadsheet based model into a Shiny web app. Some experience with R is expected, see registration page for details.
      <p><b>Prequesites</b></p>
      Some experience with R is expected (at least enough to run prepared scripts). The hands-on exercises (recommended but not required) will require participants to have a free account on Posit Cloud (i.e., so you can run prepared scripts in RStudio in a browser). Experienced R users are welcome to run the exercises in RStudio Desktop or Positron, but support will be limited.
      Parts of the workshop will require you to follow along as the instructor demonstrates code to solve a problem. It is therefore highly recommended that you have a computer with two monitors, so you can view the instructor's screen on one monitor, and work in RStudio in the other. Participants who only have a small laptop with no external monitor may find it challenging to complete the hands-on exercises, and may just want to watch.

  description: "This interactive seminar introduces participants to the transformative potential of AI-assisted data visualization. Drawing on emerging practices in 'vibe coding'—an intuitive, natural language approach to AI-assisted development—attendees will explore best practices for generating sophisticated, data-driven dashboards through prompting and iterative collaboration with AI.

    The session will overview key principles for effective interactive data visualization, demonstrate practical workflows for AI-assisted coding, and showcase real-world applications ranging from exploratory data analysis to publication-ready research dashboards. Participants will learn how to leverage AI tools to rapidly prototype visualizations and iterate design concepts while maintaining analytical rigor and aesthetic sophistication.

    Whether you're looking to extract deeper insights from existing datasets, build interactive dashboards for research, or develop comprehensive analytic framework for ongoing work, this seminar will equip you with practical strategies for integrating AI assistance into your data visualization workflows.

    No advanced coding experience required—just curiosity about how AI can augment your data practice."

  description: "Drone images have allowed researchers to investigate novel questions due to their incredible spatial resolution. Ironically however, the level of detail in drone imagery renders traditional image analysis methods largely ineffective. This webinar will describe how Deep Learning methods can be used for object detection and segmentation in high resolution imagery. A workflow for doing Deep Learning in ArcGIS Pro will be explained, with a comparison of the results of two commonly used Deep Learning algorithms (MASK R-CNN and SAM) applied to drone imagery of orchard trees taken at different times of the year."
