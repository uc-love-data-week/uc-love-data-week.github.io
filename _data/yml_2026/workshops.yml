There are several interactive tools designed to help with the selection process. These include filterable repository “finders,” lists of desirable repository characteristics outlined by funders, and subject-specific repository searching sites. In this session, learners will get an overview of these tools and a summary document with links."

    <li> How many incoming UC freshman are California residents? </li>
    <li> How many students are majoring in mechanical engineering at UC San Diego? </li>
    <li> How many patients are served by UC’s six medical centers? </li>
    <li> What country does UC publish more research than annually? </li>
    </ul>
    These questions, and many others, are answerable – if you know where to find the data! In this workshop, we'll learn how to find and access raw data and aggregate statistics, using UC-specific questions as examples. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of where to locate UC data, levels of data availability, common data privacy considerations, and how UC librarians can help you get data!"

  description: "Modern GenAI vision models can describe scenes and identify objects impressively well, but their classifications can still shift depending on how they are prompted. This talk explores a GenAI system’s ability to detect smoking imagery in a visually busy ’80s sci-fi video by breaking the video into 1-second frames and evaluating two prompts: one that encourages detection and one that emphasizes neutrality. Multiple runs of each prompt are compared to examine changes in precision, recall, accuracy, and overall consistency. The session offers a practical look at how prompt phrasing and model variability affect real-world use cases, and what to keep in mind when using GenAI tools for content analysis."

  description: "Wikipedia is among the most visited websites in the world, but even Wikipedia's staff acknowledge that its content reflects its editorship (75.6 percent of US editors are white and 90 percent are male). These editors decide which topics are 'notable' and therefore worthy of inclusion, which often excludes genderqueer and female individuals and topics from the global South. You can be part of the solution! Join us on February 11 on Zoom for a tutorial for the beginner Wikipedian, then edit some Wikipedia entries yourself. <a href=\"https://auth.wikimedia.org/enwiki/wiki/Special:CreateAccount?useformat=desktop&usesul3=1&returnto=Main+Page&centralauthLoginToken=1388602bd46760cc02df3da9c78c6528\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for a free Wikipedia account</a> in advance (optional). You may bring topic ideas or articles you'd like to edit, or we'll help you find a way to make a difference in an area of interest to you."

  description: Are you tired of spending your time manually formatting tables for article submission? Does the idea of pasting regression coefficients from R to Excel make you wince? This session will demo how to make publication-quality (and reproducible!) data tables in R. We'll use the `gt` package to showcase options for table customization and the `gtsummary` package for ways to combine model outputs with table creation. Note that this session assumes a working knowledge of R; we will dive straight into main table content without a general overview of R.

Interactive graphics open up new possibilities by letting viewers zoom in, filter, and engage with data in ways static figures cannot. In this session, we’ll explore what makes a visualization interactive, when it’s worth using, and how simple interactions can add insight. We’ll look at a few short examples using tools such as DataTables, Plotly, and Shiny. You will leave with practical tips on creating, sharing, and sustaining interactive graphics. <p>No prior experience with interactive visualization is required.</p>"

  description: Although R is an incredibly powerful programming language for data analysis and decision support, it is not widely known among the general public. The Shiny package enables R users to turn their data analysis code into web applications with user-friendly interfaces that are easy to deploy. This hands-on workshop will provide an introduction to Shiny including the principles of reactive programming, fundamentals of UI design, and deployment options. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to convert a spreadsheet based model into a Shiny web app. Some experience with R is expected, see registration page for details.
      <p><b>Prequesites</b></p>
      Some experience with R is expected (at least enough to run prepared scripts). The hands-on exercises (recommended but not required) will require participants to have a free account on Posit Cloud (i.e., so you can run prepared scripts in RStudio in a browser). Experienced R users are welcome to run the exercises in RStudio Desktop or Positron, but support will be limited.
      Parts of the workshop will require you to follow along as the instructor demonstrates code to solve a problem. It is therefore highly recommended that you have a computer with two monitors, so you can view the instructor's screen on one monitor, and work in RStudio in the other. Participants who only have a small laptop with no external monitor may find it challenging to complete the hands-on exercises, and may just want to watch.
