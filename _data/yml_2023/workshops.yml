  description: Have you heard of linked data or Wikidata and want to know what they
    are, and how you can use them?  Have you ever wondered why there are so many wiki*thing*.org
    websites, and how they're interconnected? This is the workshop for you! \n\nWikidata
    is a free and open knowledge base that provides structured, linked data not just
    for Wikipedia, but to anyone. It is used globally by many sites and services.\n\nIn
    this workshop we will describe what Wikidata is and used for; how it's connected
    to Wikimedia projects (such as Wikipedia); how it's leveraged by many other sites
    and services as a point of open data; and more importantly, an overview of how
    you can edit and use it.

  description: "Virtual Reality (VR) has evolved from an expensive and finicky niche
    technology only available at well-funded large institutions, into a practical
    consumer product with tremendous research potential. While current-generation
    VR devices are primarily intended for the video gaming market, their use is not
    limited to gaming and has tremendous potential for researchers. The VR Research
    Initiative at UC Davis DataLab is translating visualization technology initially
    created for the UC Davis W.M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth
    Sciences (KeckCAVES), to function with modern commodity VR devices. By developing
    and supporting open-source software for gaming VR headsets, DataLab seeks to promote
    equitable access to emerging technologies and enable diverse communities of researchers
    and the public to explore 3D data. In this session, we will discuss the fundamental
    principles and reasons why VR is highly effective for the analysis of large and
    complex three-dimensional data. We will introduce several concrete VR applications
    based on those principles that are being developed at UC Davis DataLab, and will
    describe how participants can build their own VR systems, able to run DataLabs
    VR applications, at their own institutions. By the end of this session participants
    will be able to: describe how current-generation virtual reality (VR) technology
    such as VR headsets meant for gaming can effectively be used for scientific data
    analysis; discuss why VR is useful for analysis of data, specifically complex
    and large three-dimensional data; and identify where to go to learn more about
    setting up their own VR systems using the latest VR technologies for research."

  description: "Technical advancements through data science combined with the exponential increase in data has led to research breakthroughs across domains and generated entirely new industries. But, lagging behind this growth is our understanding of the evolving socio-technical landscape and ability to predict the indirect consequences of our work. While laws determine the legal parameters governing data use, data science approaches that are technically legal can still be used unethically and irresponsibly, with disastrous consequences from loss of revenue to human rights violations. Through case studies and interactive sessions, this workshop provides an overview of how to practice responsible data science by incorporating considerations of ethics, equity, and justice. We will discuss FACT (fairness, accuracy, confidentiality, and transparency) based approaches to increasing the integrity of our work in data science. By the end of this workshop, learner should be able to:
    Describe examples of how the development of data science can both contribute to inequities and be leveraged to address them in their own domain.
    Begin to identify the underlying goals and incentives influencing their data-driven research.
    Assess whether a research project’s data meets FAIR criteria.
    Use a responsible data science framework to evaluate the potential impact(s) of a research project case study.
    Revise their research design using FACT principles."

This workshop will introduce participants to both technical resources and ethical considerations for the reuse of library collections as research data. We will discuss the importance of metadata and documentation when using collections as data, and will look at one tool for computationally analyzing collections (HathiTrust Research Center Analytics). We will also explore some specific collections held by UCR Library that are available to use as data for historical research.

    techniques that transform data into visualizations that accelerate research and
    facilitate communication. Kendall-Bar will share tools and tips to bring your
    data to life with data visualization tools and coding languages from PowerPoint
    to R, Python, Javascript, ArcGIS, Adobe After Effects, and Autodesk Maya. We will
    share tutorials and demos, show examples of the visualizations that are possible
    within these programs, and have some time at the end to do some collective dataviz
    brainstorming regarding specific datasets from workshop attendees.

  description: Join us for a Wikidata edit-a-thon!  This is a great opportunity to
    learn basic Wikidata editing skills, and how Wikidata can be relevant to your
    research.  From 10 - 11am, we'll cover how to add and edit Wikidata items.  From
    11am until 1pm, you can choose your level of participation.  Dive into some hands-on
    solo editing or ask questions.  While you can bring your own data projects, we
    will have a project list, so everything you need to successfully edit or upload
    a Wikidata item will be provided during the session.  \n\nNo previous knowledge
    of Wikidata is necessary, but we highly recommend attending the Wikidata Basics
    workshop held on Monday, February 13, 2023.

  description: "This workshop will give an overview of basic qualitative research methods, starting with (a little) theory, and moving on to sampling and theme development. We will then take a look at open tools for qualitative data analysis. After a brief demo of Taguette, other tools, such as QDA Miner, qcoder and QualCoder, will be reviewed.  Additional resources will be mentioned and the slides/links made available."

  description: ArcGIS Pro is ESRI's powerhouse desktop application for all things
    GIS. It can do anything from basic cartography to advanced geospatial modeling,
    and is well intergrated with web mapping and accessing online data. This introductory
    workshop will get you started creating maps using local and online GIS data. All
    UC students and staff should have access to ArcGIS software (to find out who to
    contact at your campus, see https://uc-gis-ucop.hub.arcgis.com). Temporary workshop
    licenses are also available.
